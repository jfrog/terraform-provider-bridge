# Bridge Provider

The [JFrog](https://jfrog.com/) Bridge provider is used to manage JFrog Bridge connections between a Bridge Server (SaaS JPD) and Bridge Client (Self-managed JPD). The provider needs to be configured with proper credentials before it can be used.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    bridge = {
      source  = "jfrog/bridge"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the provider
provider "bridge" {
  url          = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io"
  access_token = "my-admin-token"  # Or use JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN env var
  insecure     = false             # Set to true to skip TLS verification
}

# Create a bridge
resource "bridge" "demo" {
  bridge_id     = "demo"
  pairing_token = "<pairing token from bridge server>"  # Required on create

  remote = {
    url      = "https://your_SaaS_JPD.org"
    insecure = false
  }

  local = {
    url = "https://your_self_managed_JPD:8082"
  }
}
```

## Authentication

The Bridge provider supports several ways to authenticate:

### Access Token (Recommended)

```terraform
provider "bridge" {
  url          = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io"
  access_token = "my-admin-token"
  insecure     = false
}
```

Environment variables:
```bash
export JFROG_URL="https://myinstance.jfrog.io"
export JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN="my-admin-token"
```

### OIDC Provider

```terraform
provider "bridge" {
  url                = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io"
  oidc_provider_name = "my-oidc-provider"
}
```

### Terraform Cloud Workload Identity

When running in Terraform Cloud with proper OIDC configuration, the provider can automatically use workload identity tokens.

## Schema

### Optional

- `access_token` (String, Sensitive) Access token with Admin privileges. This can also be sourced from the `JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Skip TLS certificate verification. Use with caution, only for testing with self-signed certificates. Default: `false`.
- `oidc_provider_name` (String) OIDC provider name. See [Configure an OIDC Integration](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-platform-administration-documentation/configure-an-oidc-integration) for more details.
- `tfc_credential_tag_name` (String) Terraform Cloud Workload Identity Token tag name. Use for generating multiple TFC workload identity tokens.
- `url` (String) JFrog Platform URL. This can also be sourced from the `JFROG_URL` environment variable.

## Bridge API Endpoints

This provider uses the following JFrog Bridge Client API endpoints:

* `POST /bridge-client/api/v1/bridges` - Create a new bridge
* `PATCH /bridge-client/api/v1/bridges/{id}` - Update bridge configuration
* `DELETE /bridge-client/api/v1/bridges/{id}` - Delete a bridge
