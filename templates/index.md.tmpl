# Bridge Provider

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

### Create a Bridge

```terraform
resource "bridge" "example" {
  bridge_id     = "my-bridge"
  pairing_token = var.pairing_token  # Required on create

  remote = {
    url = "https://saas-jpd.jfrog.io"
  }

  local = {
    url = "https://self-managed-jpd:8082"
  }
}
```

## Authentication

The Bridge provider supports several ways to authenticate:

### Access Token (Recommended)

The provider requires an Access Token with Admin privileges to interact with the Bridge API.

```terraform
provider "bridge" {
  url          = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io"
  access_token = "my-admin-token"
  insecure     = false  # Set to true to skip TLS verification
}
```

You can also use environment variables:

```bash
export JFROG_URL="https://myinstance.jfrog.io"
export JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN="my-admin-token"
```

### OIDC Provider

```terraform
provider "bridge" {
  url                = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io"
  oidc_provider_name = "my-oidc-provider"
}
```

### Terraform Cloud Workload Identity

When running in Terraform Cloud with proper OIDC configuration, the provider can automatically use workload identity tokens.

## Bridge API Endpoints

This provider uses the following JFrog Bridge Client API endpoints:

* `POST /bridge-client/api/v1/bridges` - Create a new bridge
* `PATCH /bridge-client/api/v1/bridges/{id}` - Update bridge configuration
* `DELETE /bridge-client/api/v1/bridges/{id}` - Delete a bridge
